system_install_scripts
======================

Collection of scripts I maintain showing how to install and setup my various systems.

In order to run these, you will need to FIRST enter the command:

    sudo apt-get install git
    
Once you have installed git locally, clone this repo with the command:

    git clone https://github.com/Choens/system_install_scripts

Have a nice day.
