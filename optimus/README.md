# Optimus

This is my setup scripts for Optimus. Optimus is my current laptop. It
is a Dell XPS 13. I bought it with Ubuntu 12.04, which I have
subsequently replaced with Kubuntu. I use the current versions and
tend to upgrade during one of the later ALPHAS or BETA 1. I upgrade
Rodimus, my desktop first, but I do like to live on the cutting edge a
little.
