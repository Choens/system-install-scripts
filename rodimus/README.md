# Rodimus

This is my install scripts for Rodimus, my desktop. I am a little more
daring with Rodimus, since I don't use it as my portable
workstation. I used Optimus too much at work to be able to risk it
blowing up completely on me. It tends to get upgraded quickly in the
release cycle and may or may not be fully functional at any given moment.
